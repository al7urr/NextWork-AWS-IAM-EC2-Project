# NextWork AWS IAM & EC2 Project

## ‚úÖ Project Overview
In this project, I learned to **launch EC2 instances** and **manage access using IAM**. I created separate **production and development environments**, set up **users, groups, and policies**, and tested permissions to ensure secure access.

## üõ† Key Services and Concepts
- **EC2** ‚Äì Launching and managing virtual servers.  
- **IAM** ‚Äì Creating users, groups, and permission policies.  
- **Tags** ‚Äì Organizing resources by environment (production vs development).  
- **Account Alias** ‚Äì Simplifying console login URLs.  
- **Access Control** ‚Äì Restricting user actions based on policies.

## üîß Steps Completed
1. Launched **two EC2 instances**: production and development.  
2. Tagged instances with **Env = production/development**.  
3. Created a **JSON IAM policy** to restrict access.

4. Created **IAM user and group** for the intern.  
5. Shared **intern sign-in details** (username & password) for testing.

6. Tested access:
   - Tried stopping the **production instance** ‚Üí got **access denied**.  
   - Stopped the **development instance successfully**.

## üìå Key Learnings
- How to **safely separate development and production environments**.  
- How **IAM policies, groups, and users work together** to control access.  
- Practical experience with **EC2 instance management**.

## ‚è± Time Taken
This project took approximately **1 hour**.  
The most challenging part was **setting up the IAM policy correctly**, and the most rewarding part was **testing the intern's access successfully**.

## üí° Reflection
I chose this project to **gain hands-on experience with AWS access management and EC2 instances**.  
It helped me understand **secure cloud practices** and gave me confidence to manage real AWS environments.
